TODO:
* Focus on rest of site before revising index.
* Improve "what" section.
* (perhaps) center down arrow, make either fainter or maybe slightly larger. Make it clickable (to take you to the next scrolldown page).
* Make ncurses animations (if by some stroke of god I have more than I need, consider randomizing)
* Possibly use other headers if effective
